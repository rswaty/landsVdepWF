## This site...

is a demo site built in R-Studio in a couple hours (**read:** not proofed, code not well annotated and no QAQC completed) with the [workflowR](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html#overview) package as a way to: 

1. explore the potential of using LANDFIRE's [Vegetation Departure](https://www.landfire.gov/vdep.php) Dataset for TNC (and other) parcels
2. demonstrate using a website to share code, data and outputs
3. prompt more discussion about how to measure ecological condition

While just a quick demo site we hope it evolves and provokes conversation.  Contact Randy Swaty at rswaty@tnc.org with questions.

## Quick methods
To assess vegetation conditions over time, and inside/outside of protected areas Sarah Hagen did a "Combine" in ArcMap then joined in attributes of the following datasets:

* LANDFIRE Vegetation Departure, Versions 105 (year 2001), 110 (2008), 130 (2012) (see https://www.landfire.gov/vdep.php)
* LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (represents historical ecosystems)
* TNC Parcels (*plus matched unprotected?*)

Sarah shared data with Randy Swaty via Excel workbook.  Randy then formatted data there using Pivot tables (careful! must filter, etc. appropriatedly.  As of 31Aug2020 specifics not documented here), then saved specific data files as .csv files for charting in R.
